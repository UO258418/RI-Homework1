1. No, I couldn't because the iterator pointing to next in the result set is already at the end after the first 
time I call display, so there's nothing more to be shown when we call display again


2. Yes, I could this time thanks to the scrolling:

public static void display(ResultSet rs) throws SQLException {
		rs.beforeFirst();
		System.out.println();
		while(rs.next()) System.out.printf(" - Id: %d Price: %d Stock: %f\n", 
				rs.getInt("id"), rs.getInt("price"), rs.getFloat("stock"));
}


3. No, I couldn't due to the fact that executing Update over the same statement closes the result set and so 
when you try to display again theres an error


4. In the database I can see the updates made by the program.
